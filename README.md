## Quarantine React Web Chat App
Quaranchill is a web application that allows users to reconnect with other people. It is a fully fledged world chat system separated by hobbies to facilitate better communication between users. We used a Node.js express and React framework to create this app. The home page displays a basic user login using BCrypt and JWT technology. We used Socket.Io, a JavaScript library for realtime web applications to create this group chat system. We used Materialize for UI, Redux for state management and MongoDB for database management.
