## Quarantine React Web Chat App
Our Quaranchill website is a way to reconnect with other people. Quaranchill is a fully fledged world chat system separated by hobbies to facilitate better communication between users. We used a Node.js express and React framework to create this app. The home page displays a basic user login using BCrypt technology. We used Socket.Io, a JavaScript library for realtime web applications to create this group chat system. We used React Bootstrap for UI, and MongoDB for database management.
